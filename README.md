# Challenges
A key limitation faced during the analysis pertains to handling promotions under the **'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free)** category. The dataset does not effectively capture the quantity of free items given as part of the promotion. This gap may result in inconsistencies or misinterpretations, especially when assessing the impact of 'BOGOF' promotions and drawing comparisons with other promotional strategies.


# Conclusions
This analysis offers meaningful insights into the effectiveness of AtliQ Mart's promotional campaigns during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By utilizing data analytics, AtliQ Mart can refine its marketing strategies, increase customer engagement, and boost sales during festive seasons.
